Hackazon
========

Hackazon is a free, vulnerable test site that is an online storefront built with the same
technologies used in today’s rich client and mobile applications. Hackazon has an AJAX
interface, strict workflows and RESTful API’s used by a companion mobile app providing
uniquely-effective training and testing ground for IT security professionals. And, it’s
full of your favorite vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, cross-site scripting and so on.

Today’s web and mobile applications as well as web services have a host of new
technologies that are not being adequately tested for security vulnerabilities. It is
critical for IT security professionals to have a vulnerable web application to use for
testing the effectiveness of their tools and for honing their skills.

Hackazon enables users to configure each area of the application in order to change the
vulnerability landscape to prevent “known vuln testing” or any other form of ‘cheating.’
Since the application includes RESTful interfaces that power AJAX functionality and
mobile clients (JSON, XML, GwT, and AMF), users will need to the latest application
security testing tools and techniques to discover all the vulnerabilities. Hackazon also
requires detailed testing of strict workflows, like shopping carts,that are commonly used
in business applications.
